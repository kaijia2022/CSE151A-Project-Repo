## Preprocessing Plan 
We plan on viewing our data and looking at any categorical values and one hot encoding them. We see that there is a star color and a spectral class, so we will one hot encode those. They are categorical data that are nominal and we do not want to have one to be greater than the other. We will then use min max scaling to normalize each field of the input data.
